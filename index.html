        <h2 class = "navy-header"><b>Singapore</b></h2>
        <p id="italicsParagraph">Singapore was the first country I landed in during my time in the Navy. 
        The surreal experience of being in this foreign land was pretty intense. 
        I had never really been outside the United States prior to touching foot in Singapore. 
        Also, the total flight time to get to Singapore was roughly 21 hours so it was nice to be on land again.</p>

        <h2 class = "navy-header"><b>Malaysia</b></h2>
        <p>Malaysia was the first country my ship, USS Sterett (DDG-104), landed in 
        durng my first full deployement.  I was was super excited for this port visit 
        considering that I now had a crew of friends to truly explore the port. Needless to say it was a memorable experience. </p>

        <h3 class = "navy-header"><b>Yokuska, Japan</b></h3>
        <p id="italicsParagraph"> Yokuska was the last 7th fleet port on my 2nd deployment.  The overall 
        feeling I can remember from this experience is just the sense of hope that 
        home was not too far off in the future.  When you're out on the ocean for so long you get 
        into a rut and days run together and home would definitely be a blessing.  The subway map pictured below will be my lasting 
        memory from this trip because its a little tricky after a few drinks.</p>

        <h4 class = "navy-header"><b>Dubai</b></h4>
        <p>Money!Money!Money!Extravagance!Extravagance!Extravagance! Those two words 
        sum up Dubai perfectly.  I took the time to actually go to the Burj Khalifa, the 
        tallest building in the world.  The Burj Khalifa is a truly mesmerizing structure that many people do not get a chance to experience. 
        Another interesting attraction in Dubai was the Mall of the Emirates.  Imagine going skiing in a 
        cournty with 100+ degree weather.  You can hit the slopes at the Ski Dubai indoor ski resort inside the Mall 
        of the Emirates. </p>

        <h5 class = "navy-header"><b>Phuket, Thailand</b></h5>
        <p id="italicsParagraph">It's hard to describe Phuket because it is all a blur full of debauchery.  I'll 
        just leave this picture of "James Bond Island".  I took a sight seeing tour to this area which was featured
        in the James Bond film, "The Man with the Golden Gun".</p>

        <h6 class = "navy-header"><b>Bali, Indonesia</b></h6>
        <p>Bali is a beautiful, inexpensive place to visit.  An amazing experince to 
        to close a 10-month deployment before heading back to the States.  The most memorable experience was a "little people" 
        wrestling match.  It was a choreographed extravaganza that pitted the USA against the 
        Aussies.  There was a heavy Aussie crowed with chants of "Aussie!Aussie!Aussie!
        oi!oi!oi!". My final overseas experience prior to separating from the Navy.</p>
