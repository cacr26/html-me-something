        <p id="listOfDestinations">Singapore<br/>
            Malaysia<br/>
            Yokuska, Japan<br/>
            Dubai<br/>

            Bali, Indonesia<br/>
        <h2 class = "navy-header"><b>Singapore</b></h2>
        <p id="italicsParagraph">Singapore was the first country I landed in during my time in the Navy. 
        The surreal experience of being in this foreign land was pretty intense. 
        I had not been outside the Missouri very much let alone the United States 
        prior to this experience.</p>

        <h2 class = "navy-header"><b>Malaysia</b></h2>
        <p>Malaysia was the first county my ship, USS Sterett (DDG-104), landed in 
        durng my first full deployement.  I was was super excited for this experience 
        considering that I now had a crew of friends to truly explore the port. </p>
        <img src = "Malaysia.jpg" alt = "Malaysia" id="images">
        <h3 class = "navy-header"><b>Yokuska, Japan</b></h3>
        <p id="italicsParagraph"> Yokuska was the last 7th fleet port on my 2nd deployment.  The overall 
        feeling I can remember from this experience is just the sense of hope that 
        home was not to far away.  When you're out on the ocean for so long you get 
        into a rut.  The subway map pictured below will always stick out in my mind 
        from this trip because it is a little trick when you're completely out of 
        your element.</p>
        <img src = "Yokuska Map.jpg" alt = "Yokuska, Japan>" id="images">
        <h4 class = "navy-header"><b>Dubai</b></h4>
        <p>Money!Money!Money!Extravagance!Extravagance!Extravagance! Those two words 
        sum up Dubai perfectly.  I took the time to actually go to the Burj Khalifa, the 
        tallest building in the world.  The Burj Khalifa is a truly mesmerizing structure. 
        One of the coolest attraction is the Mall of the Emirates.  Imagine skiing inside 
        a mall.  You can hit the slopes at the Ski Dubai indoor skir resort inside the Mall 
        of the Emirates. </p>
        <img src = "Dubai.jpg" alt = "Dubai" id="images">
        <h5 class = "navy-header"><b>Phuket, Thailand</b></h5>
        <p id="italicsParagraph">It's hard to describe Phuket because it is all a blur full of debauchery.  I'll 
        just leave this picture.</p>
        <img src = "James Bond Island.jpg" alt = "Phuket" id="images">
        <h6 class = "navy-header"><b>Bali, Indonesia</b></h6>
        <p>Bali is a beautiful, inexpensive place to visit.  An amazing experince to 
        to end a 10-month deployment.  The most memorable experience was "little people" 
        wrestling.  It was a choreographed extravaganza that pitted the USA against the 
        Aussies.  This was a heavy Aussie crowed with chants of "Aussie!Aussie!Aussie!
        oi!oi!oi!". Another great experience before separating from the Navy.</p>
