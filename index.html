        <a>Bali, Indonesia</a><br/>
        <h2><b>>Singapore</b></h2>
        <p>Singapore was the first country I landed in during my time in the Navy. <br/>
        The surreal experience of being in this foreign land was pretty intense. <br/>
        I had not been outside the Missouri very much let alone the United States <br/>
        prior to this experience.</p>

        <h2><b>Malaysia</b></h2>
        <p>Malaysia was the first county my ship, USS Sterett (DDG-104), landed in <br/>
        durng my first full deployement.  I was was super excited for this experience <br/>
        considering that I now had a crew of friends to truly explore the port. </p>

        <h3><b>Yokuska, Japan</b></h3>
        <p>Yokuska was the last 7th fleet port on my 2nd deployment.  The overall <br/>
        feeling I can remember from this experience is just the sense of hope that <br/>
        home was not to far away.  When you're out on the ocean for so long you get <br/>
        into a rut.  The subway map pictured below will always stick out in my mind <br/>
        from this trip because it is a little trick when you're completely out of <br/>
        your element.</p>

        <h4><b>Dubai</b></h4>
        <p>Money!Money!Money!Extravagance!Extravagance!Extravagance! Those two words <br/>
        sum up Dubai perfectly.  I took the time to actually go to the Burj Khalifa, the <br/>
        tallest building in the world.  The Burj Khalifa is a truly mesmerizing structure. <br/>
        One of the coolest attraction is the Mall of the Emirates.  Imagine skiing inside <br/>
        a mall.  You can hit the slopes at the Ski Dubai indoor skir resort inside the Mall <br/>
        of the Emirates. </p>

        <h5><b>Phuket, Thailand</b></h5>
        <p>It's hard to describe Phuket because it is all a blur full of debauchery.  I'll <br/>
        just leave this picture.</p>

        <h6><b>Bali, Indonesia</b></h6>
        <p>Bali is a beautiful, inexpensive place to visit.  An amazing experince to <br/>
        to end a 10-month deployment.  The most memorable experience was "little people" <br/>
        wrestling.  It was a choreographed extravaganza that pitted the USA against the <br/>
        Aussies.  This was a heavy Aussie crowed with chants of "Aussie!Aussie!Aussie!<br/>
        oi!oi!oi!". Another great experience before separating from the Navy.</p>
